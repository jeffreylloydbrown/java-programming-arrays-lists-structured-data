This is my coursework for Coursera's Java Programming: Arrays, Lists, and Structured Data class from Duke University. Use at your own risk. I'm considering 
it public domain.

I originally audited this class in early 2018. I've come back to convert that audit into a certificate. 

I use IntelliJ at work, and thought long and hard about using IntelliJ for this course. Ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons:

- BlueJ is a reasonably good IDE with a small memory footprint, which means it runs in memory-restricted Raspberry Pi devices. IntelliJ struggles to run in 2GB on a Pi 3 and runs fairly ok, but not perfectly, on a 4GB Pi 4.
- it doesn't hurt to get experience with multiple development environments. While I doubt I will ever see BlueJ at a job, it is still good to compare and contrast it with a full-blown IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
